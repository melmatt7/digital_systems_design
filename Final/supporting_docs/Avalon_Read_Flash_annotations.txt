This simulation clearly illustrates the correct operation of this FSM that reads from a 
certain address given the correct signals. Notice that Start needs to be high, and 
dataValid and waitRequest need to be low and the complete signal is output upon every completed read.
It should be noted that waitRequest and dataValid are signals coming from the flash and don't 
ordinraily take the form seen in the simulation.
