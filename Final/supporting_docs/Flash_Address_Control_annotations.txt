Start in the idle state and move to read_flash upone recieving a read signal from the keyboard. 
Upon recieving a complete signal from the avalon flash read module the FSM moves to data output 
phase (0-3) where the read data from the flash is output at the desired rate of 7200Hz. Next, the 
address is incremented and checked to see if the end of the phoneme has been reached. In the case
that phoneme is complete, a full handshake protocol is carried out between this FSM and the Picoblaze.
The .psm file goes into detail about the handshake protocol. Once the new phoneme is fully recieved 
and the addresses are ready to be loaded, the FSM repeats from idle once more.
