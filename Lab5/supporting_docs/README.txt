1. Where (which directory) is your SOF file located
Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\output_files\dds_and_nios_lab_time_limited.sof

2. Where is your project code located (verilog and Nios software)
Verilog: 
 - Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\dds_and_nios_lab.v
 - Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\lfsr.sv
 - Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\flipflop.sv
 - Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\fast_to_slow_sync.sv
NIOS Software:
 - Lab5\lab5_template_de1soc\software\lab5\student_code\student_code.c

3. What is the status of the lab (what works, what doesn't)
Lab 5 is complete (ASK, BPSK, FSK, LFSR all working). 
The current implementation has the QPSK bonus implemented such that the BPSK 
button actually displays QPSK modulation.

4. Where (which directory) are your simulation screenshots located
Lab5\supporting_docs\*

5. Any additional information that would be relevant for the TA marking your lab.
